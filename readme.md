## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic form that generates a password that is easy to remember but hard to crack.

## Additional Info to TA
* I would have liked to add some password strength functionality but time did not permit it.
* The form resets after each generated password
* I used a very large dictionary list (~1.1MB), password generation load time is affected by this.
